# Mods directory

This directory contains the source of the community provided mod files.

The mods are available for non-technical users to download at [https://idlemod.svit.ac](https://idlemod.svit.ac)
(you can alternatively compile them by yourself - follow instructions in the main [README.md](https://github.com/SKevo18/idlemod/blob/main/README.md))

## Generic install instructions

1. Obtain the modded data file;
2. Replace it with the data file in the game installation's directory;
    - **I highly recommend you to backup the original data file in some way**, in case anything goes wrong (e. g.: by renaming it or adding `.old` suffix to it, so you can revert to the original file or switch between modded and original versions of the game).
