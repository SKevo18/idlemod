# No Rubber-Banding for Moorhuhn Kart: Extra

> Removes rubber-banding of AI opponents in Moorhuhn Kart: Extra. In other words, the AI moves at the same speed regardless of the player's position (doesn't matter if the player is too far ahead or too far behind - so, this can either help you or make it worse, as the AI now won't slow down when the player is too far ahead).
