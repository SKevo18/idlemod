# Data Files Root

Place your ORIGINAL Moorhuhn data files in this directory. Name the files as follows (without file extensions):

- `mhk_extra` - for Moorhuhn Kart Extra (XXL);
- `mhk_2_de` - for Moorhuhn Kart 2 (XXL), German version (original);
- `mhk_2_en` - for Moorhuhn Kart 2 (XXL), English version;
- `mhk_3` - for Moorhuhn Kart 3;
- `mhk_4` - for Moorhuhn Kart 4 (Thunder);

They will be used by the webserver at runtime, to serve the modded game files to the client.
