# Data Files Root

Place your ORIGINAL Moorhuhn data files in this directory. Name the files as follows (without file extensions):

- `mhk_extra` - for Moorhuhn Kart Extra (XXL) (`mhke.dat`);
- Moorhuhn Kart 2 (XXL) (`mhk2-00.dat`):
  - `mhk_2_de` - German version (original);
  - `mhk_2_en` - English version;
- `mhk_3` - for Moorhuhn Kart 3 (`data.sar`);
- `mhk_4` - for Moorhuhn Kart 4 (Thunder; version 1.0.3) (`data.sar`);

They will be used by the webserver at runtime, to serve the modded game files to the client.
